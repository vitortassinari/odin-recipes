Repository for the "Project: Recipes" assignment from the Odin's HTML Foundation Course

This is the last assignment from The Odin Project's HTML Foundation Course. This is where I'm supposed to apply all the knowledge I've gained from the previous lessons.
I'm really looking forward to writing my own recipe website from scratch. I think I'll need to use the HTML boilerplate, text tags, create a variety of ordered and unordered lists, and link pages and images.
I'm also excited to start the CSS course and learn how to style my first webpage.
As the assignment suggested, I'll return here after I finish the project to summarize what I've learned in the HTML Foundation Course. It's March 6, 9:00 PM. See you in the future!

Okay. It's March 10, 6 PM, and I just finished the project. It took a lot of time because I did everything in English, which it's not my first language. I wrote all
the texts and then revised them with the help of my friend Chatz (ChatGPT chose this cool name for himself!). I think everything went well. So far, my biggest challenge has been the English language, not coding itself. I'm very happy with the result!
