            <div class="recipe-description"> 
            <p>This is a delicious and healthy breakfast idea. It requires no cooking and is super quick to make. To keep it simple, use hydrated tapioca starch -
               It's very common in Brazil. If you're in another country, check Brazilian or Latin markets.</p>
            <p>For the best flavor, use high-quality natural peanut butter. Remember, peanut butter only needs one ingredient: peanuts!</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p class="recipe-description">For a healthier breakfast, I like to add a mix of seeds to the crepe filling. It also adds a nice texture. I recommend preparing the mixture in
               a separate glass jar - you can use it later with granolas, yogurt or açaí bowls, and more. To make it, simply combine equal parts of sunflower seeds, flaxseeds, 
               chia seeds, and sesame seeds.</p>
                <ul class="ingredients-list">
                    <li>4 tablespoons of hydrated tapioca starch (approximately 100 g)</li>
                    <li>1 large chopped banana</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon of peanut butter</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon of sliced oats</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon of seed mix</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon of honey</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon of cinnamon</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol class="steps-list">
                    <li>Preheat a medium-sized frying pan on the stove for a minute.</li>
                    <li>Add the tapioca starch. I like to to this directly from the bag, slowly spreading it evenly across surface of the pan. There's no need to
                        grease the pan, even if it's not non-sticky.</li>
                    <li>Before adding the filling, check if the tapioca starch is spread evenly. If not, use a spatula to finish the job.</li>
                    <li>Add the filling: start with the banana, then add the dry ingredients - this way, your spoon won't get dirty, and you'll only need one.
                        Finish with the peanut butter, then drizzle the honey on top.</li>
                    <li>Fold the crepe in half and serve.</li>
                    <li>Eat the crepe right away while it's still fresh - otherwise, it can quickly become soft.</li>
                </ol>
